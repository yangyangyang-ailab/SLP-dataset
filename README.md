# SLP-dataset

##Introduction

SLP dataset is a valuable dataset from K-12 education. It mainly has two properties:

**Multi-Dimensional**: It covers the data from five different dimensions, namely student demographic information, psychometric intelligence information, academic performance information, family information and school information;

**Consecutive**: It automatically captures the learner's academic performance data during their three-year study (mainly from 7th grade to 9th grade) on 8 different subjects, namely Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Chinese, Geography and English.

With a 3-year consecutive data collecting process among a large-scale of learners, this dataset would provide valuable information and foster the cross-disciplinary research for learning analytics on a broader canvas.

##Dataset Description

The SLP dataset is available in the form of multiple CSV files (each value is separated by comma, and the rst line in each table shows the column name). Tables can be easily linked using the unique identifier *student_id*, while only the **Table schoolInfo** uses the *school_id* as its unique identifier.
