# SLP-dataset

SLP dataset is a valuable dataset from K-12 education. It mainly has two properties:

**Multi-Dimensional**: It covers the data from five different dimensions, namely student demographic information, psychometric intelligence information, academic performance information, family information and school information;

**Consecutive**: It automatically captures the learner's academic performance data during their three-year study (mainly from 7th grade to 9th grade) on 8 different subjects, namely Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Chinese, Geography and English.

With a 3-year consecutive data collecting process among a large-scale of learners, this dataset would provide valuable information and foster the cross-disciplinary research for learning analytics on a broader canvas.
